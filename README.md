# Hello!
### My name is Anton Brink, I am a msc student in Sports Technology @KTH.
### Previously worked as a physiotherapist in SLL and in elder care.
### Looking to combine my experience in health care and sports with technology and to further my programming knowledge

## Projects I've been a part of in my master program:
* [Indicators of fatigue in football](https://github.com/AntonBrinkCodes/Indicators-of-fatigue-in-football)
  A project where we gathered and did data analysis on IMU6 attached to a football player to try to extract predictors for player fatigue
* Other projects

## Android Apps I've developed:
* [Weather Forecast](https://github.com/AntonBrinkCodes/WeatherForecast)
A simple weather app that downloads and shows weather data from SMHI based on coordinates.
* [N-back game](https://github.com/AntonBrinkCodes/NBack)
A fun N-back memory mobile game!
* [Asses UCM](https://github.com/AntonBrinkCodes/Asess-UCM)
An app intended to aid physiotherapists with diagnosing shoulder UCM. Co-developed with [Elsa Nets](https://github.com/elsanetz) and [Danny Huang](https://github.com/tyhuangdanny).
